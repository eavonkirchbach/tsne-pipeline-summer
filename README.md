**By: Erika von Kirchbach, Franklin Fuchs, Syed Hoque**

**This project's goal is to help visualize thousands of documents and their *inter-document relationships and any possible hidden trends.***

**Using the Unstructured libary and t-SNE, we created a visualization for all sorts of types of documents with a feature of filtering on what type of entity is extracted and thern graphed on the plot**
