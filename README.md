# tsne-pipeline project
**Led by Erika von Kirchbach with the help of Franklin Fuchs and Syed Hoque**

**This project's goal is to help visualize thousands of documents and their *inter-document relationships and any possible hidden trends.***

**Using the Python, t-SNE, PubMedBert, and the Unstructured libary, we were able to embed and plot documents of 22 types, including XML, PDFs, XLSX, TXT, DOCX, and more for visualization purposes** 

**Due to the use of entity extraction, filtering can be done that allows this project to be used across many departments and able to plot documents based on different entity types.**

**This is a copy of the project repository due to privacy concerns, and lacks proper history and collaboration history of this project**
